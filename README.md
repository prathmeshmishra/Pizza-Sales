I carried out a comprehensive descriptive data analysis of pizza sales across many outlets in a city over the course of a year for the Power BI + SQL project. I carefully examined sales data, utilising SQL databases and Power BI's powerful visualisation tools, to identify seasonal trends, consumer preferences, and store performance measures. The final analysis gave a thorough picture of the pizza sales environment, enabling shop owners and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and delivering insightful advice on how to maximise inventory, marketing tactics, and overall business profitability.
